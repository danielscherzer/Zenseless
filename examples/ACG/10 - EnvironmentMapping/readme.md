1. Add a sphere that reflects the environment (camera is at the center, change that to be outside the sphere)
1. Add various reflecting objects
1. Add a refracting object
1. Add objects that use Fresnel to mix refracting and reflecting components.
1. Add glossy reflecting objects (by accessing higher mipmap levels for objects with higher glossiness)
1. Texture map an object with a texture that stores the shininess (glossiness) per texel and calculate environment mapping accordingly
