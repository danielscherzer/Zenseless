# To do
1. Load your own [obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) file (only triangulated, single mesh models)
1. Load and render a textured model
1. Make the model fit inside the view-port and rotate it around the y-axis.

# Information
+ All files that you want to use in your project, should have set `Build Action` to `Embedded Resource` in the file properties. The files will be automatically compiled into the executable for easier shipping on each built.
