You will add shadow mapping to this example.
1. Create a first pass that renders the geometry to an off-screen buffer. A `FBO` for this purpose is already created in the code.
1. This first pass should be rendered from the point-of-view of the light source. A second `cameraLight` is already created in the code.
1. Adapt the `depth*.glsl` shaders so that the shadow map texture stores the depth of the scene from the point of view of a light source.
1. Adapt the other shaders to use the shadow map while rendering the scene.
1. Add depth biasing
1. Add Phong lighting (inside the shadow only ambient)
1. Add a second shadow casting light source that moves
1. Add percentage-closer-filtering
