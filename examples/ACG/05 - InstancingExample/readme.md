1. What happens if you do not use the instance_position in the vertex shader?
1. Remove near-plane clipping artifacts.
1. Add instance attribute velocity (an individual speed and direction for each sphere) and move spheres in vertex shader.
1. Also add instance attributes color and rotation and change the shaders to account for them.
1. Change the instance shape (obj file)
